# UVM_mixed_bag ðŸ§ª

A curated collection of SystemVerilog + UVM coding challenges for Design Verification Engineers â€” especially useful for preparing for interviews at companies like NVIDIA, AMD, Apple, Intel, Meta, and others.

Each problem focuses on one or more of the following:
- UVM sequences, transactions, monitors, scoreboards
- SystemVerilog constraint logic
- Factory override and testbench reusability
- Coverage-driven verification
- Protocol modeling and functional checkers
- Mixed-in scripting logic (e.g. Python or Makefile)

## ðŸ§  Why This Repo?

This repo helps DV engineers:
- Strengthen their understanding of key UVM concepts
- Practice constraint/debug/coverage scenarios in interview-style format
- Build up reusable patterns for real-world verification

Each problem includes:
- ðŸ“„ `problem.md` â€” clearly stated prompt and expectations
- ðŸ§  Constraints or modeling logic
- âœ… `*.sv` solution with clean comments
- (Optional) Python or scripting equivalents where applicable
